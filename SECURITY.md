# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest production version of Plasma is supported. Finding security vulnerabilities no longer present in the latest version of Plasma does not help us.
Contributors on Plasma **MUST** have Two-Factor Authentication enabled. If comprimised they are to be notified via Discord, and permission to push will be revoked.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please open a vulnerability report, and describe **in detail** the vulnerability.

**Please do not discuss unpatched security vulnerabilities to anyone.**
