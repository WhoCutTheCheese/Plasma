 # 🌌 Plasma Discord Bot
 Plasma is a helpful Discord bot with many features, such at leveling, message tracking, invite management, giveaways and more! Plasma is always looking to improve, so feel free to create a feature request, or open an issue to report a bug!

## 🌟 Features & Changes
We do not want Plasma to become bloated. I plan to update and improve the core features as much as I can to offer as much customization and value to server owners.
It's unlikely Plasma will add any new core features, but if an idea arises that is of value we will consider adding it.

Don't let this discourage you from suggesting new features! Even if we are unlikely to add new things, we always want to hear what YOU would like added to the bot. Feel free to open an issue if you have a suggestion.
